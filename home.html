                        <p class="contenttext">
                        Afforestation is the process of establishing a forest or stand of trees in an area where there was no previous tree
                        cover. This involves planting trees in areas that haven't recently had any tree cover, in order to create a forest. The
                        type of land planted could include areas that have turned into desert (through desertification), places that have long
                        been used for grazing, disused agricultural fields, or industrial areas. Afforestation is an increasingly sought-after
                        method to fight climate concerns, as it is known to increase the soil quality and organic carbon levels into the soil,
                        avoiding desertification.<p>

                        <p class="contenttext">
                        Afforestation is important to Saudi Arabia because it is part of the countryâ€™s pledge to tackle carbon emissions and
                        combat climate change. The country has launched several initiatives to increase afforestation in the region, including
                        planting large swathes of forest and vegetation1. In fact, Saudi Arabia plans to plant 10 billion trees in the desert as
                        part of its efforts to combat desertification and reduce carbon emissions.
