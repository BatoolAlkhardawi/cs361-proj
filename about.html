                        difference in our community by reforesting the desert. Our mission is to plant trees and other vegetation in areas that
                        have been affected by desertification, and we are always looking for more volunteers to join us in our efforts. By
                        volunteering with us, you will have the chance to make a real impact on the environment and help combat climate change.

                        Our national Saudi volunteering group was formed in 2015 by a group of passionate individuals who wanted to make a
                        difference in our community. Since then, we have grown significantly and have been able to make a real impact on the
                        environment by reforesting the desert. We are always looking for more volunteers to join us in our efforts, and we hope
                        that you will consider joining our team!
